# Problem 3: Find All Duplicate Treasure Chests in an Array
# Captain Blackbeard has an integer array chests of length n where all the integers 
# in chests are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice. 
# Return an array of all the integers that appear twice, representing the 
# treasure chests that have duplicates.

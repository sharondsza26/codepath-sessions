# Problem 4: Scheduling Conflict
# Demand for your festival has exceeded expectations, so you're expanding the festival 
# to span two different venues. Some artists will perform both venues, while others will 
# perform at just one. To ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts, implement a function 
# identify_conflicts() that accepts two dictionaries venue1_schedule and venue2_schedule each
# mapping the artists playing at the venue to their set times. Return a dictionary containing 
# the key-value pairs that are the same in each schedule.

def identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule):
    conflict = {}
    
    for artist, time in venue1_schedule.items():
        if time == venue2_schedule.get(artist, ""):
            conflict[artist] = time
        
    return conflict
    

venue1_schedule = {
    "Stromae": "9:00 PM",
    "Janelle Monáe": "8:00 PM",
    "HARDY": "7:00 PM",

}

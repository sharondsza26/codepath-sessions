# Problem 8: Merging Missions
# The Avengers are planning multiple missions, and each mission has a priority level represented as a node in a linked list. You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, mission1 and mission2, where each node represents a mission with its priority level.

# Implement a recursive function merge_missions() which merges these two mission lists into one sorted list, ensuring that the combined list maintains the correct order of priorities. The merged list should be made by splicing together the nodes from the first two lists.

# Return the head of the merged mission linked list.

class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, next=None):
      self.value = value
      self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def merge_missions(mission1, mission2):
    if not mission1:
        return mission2
    if not mission2:
        return mission1

    if mission1.value < mission2.value:
        mission1.next = merge_missions(mission1.next, mission2)
        return mission1
    else:
        mission2.next = merge_missions(mission1, mission2.next)
        return mission2
# Example Usage:

mission1 = Node(1, Node(2, Node(4)))
mission2 = Node(1, Node(3, Node(4)))

print_linked_list(merge_missions(mission1, mission2))
# 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

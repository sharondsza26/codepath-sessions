# Problem 2: Two-Pointer Reverse List
# Write a function reverse_list() that takes in a list lst and returns elements of the list 
# in reverse order. The list should be reversed in-place without using list slicing (e.g. lst[::-1]).

# Instead, use the two-pointer approach, which is a common technique in which we initialize 
# two variables (also called a pointer in this context) to track different indices or places 
# in a list or string, then moves the pointers to point at new indices based on certain conditions. 
# In the most common variation of the two-pointer approach, we initialize one variable to point at 
# the beginning of a list and a second variable/pointer to point at the end of list. We then shift 
# the pointers to move inwards through the list towards each other, until our problem is solved or 
# the pointers reach the opposite ends of the list.

def reverse_list(lst):
    left = 0
    right = len(lst) -1
    temp = 0
    
    while left < right :
        temp = lst[left]
        lst[left] = lst[right]
        lst[right] = temp
        
        left += 1
        right -= 1
        
    print(lst)


lst = ["pooh", "christopher robin", "piglet", "roo", "eeyore"]
reverse_list(lst)

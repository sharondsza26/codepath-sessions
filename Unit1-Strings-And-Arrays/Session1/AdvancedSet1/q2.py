# Problem 2: Bouncy, Flouncy, Trouncy, Pouncy
# Tigger has developed a new programming language Tiger with only four operations and one variable tigger.

# bouncy and flouncy both increment the value of the variable tigger by 1.
# trouncy and pouncy both decrement the value of the variable tigger by 1.
# Initially, the value of tigger is 1 because he's the only tigger around! 
# Given a list of strings operations containing a list of operations, 
# return the final value of tigger after performing all the operations.
